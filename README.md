# Space-Invaders

## Dependencies
These are the packages I had installed on Ubuntu:
* libglew-dev
* libglu1-mesa-dev
* free-glut3-dev
* mesa-common-dev
* build-essential
* libglfw3-dev

## Building the Game
You can build the game by using the makefile:
```$ make```

This creates the executable binary, which is called **invaders**.
